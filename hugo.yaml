    Title: Hi there! 👋
    Content: >
      I'm Paolo, and this blog is still very much a work in progress.
      

      With over 10 years as a software engineer (currently at a fintech company), I'd love to share my thoughts on coding, tech, my homelab projects, and anything else that piques my interest.
